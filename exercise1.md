# Continuous Integration in Python Development

I did choose Python as a language for considering issues related to CI. Here I present some links relevant to the assignment. These were found using Google and ChatGPT.

## CI Tools in Python Ecosystem 

- **Linting**: [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) and [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) are two of the most popular linting tools in the Python ecosystem. These tools check the code against coding standards and detect potential errors or bad practices.
- **Testing**: Python's standard library comes with the [`unittest`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module, which provides a testing framework. Additionally, [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is a widely used third-party testing tool that offers a more flexible and feature-rich testing framework.
- **Building**: For projects that need to be packaged and distributed, [setuptools](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/) and [wheel](https://wheel.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are available.

## CI Alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions

Beyond Jenkins and GitHub Actions, other CI services include:

- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/): A cloud-based service that can be integrated with GitHub repositories.
- [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/): Offers both cloud-based and on-premises CI solutions.
- [GitLab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/): Comes integrated with GitLab repositories, but can also work with external repositories.
- [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines): Integrated CI/CD for Bitbucket repositories.

## Self-hosted vs. Cloud-based CI Environment

The choice between self-hosted and cloud-based CI setups depends on various factors:

- **Scale and Cost**: For smaller teams, cloud-based solutions might be more economical. However, as the scale grows, costs might become a concern, making self-hosted solutions more attractive.
- **Security and Compliance**: If the project handles sensitive data or needs to comply with strict regulations, a self-hosted solution might offer better control.
- **Customization and Integration**: Self-hosted solutions often provide greater flexibility for customization and integration with other tools. However, setting up self-hosted system involves additional effort (configuration and maintenance) and possibly also extra costs.

To make an informed decision, it's essential to assess the project's current and future requirements, cost constraints, and the team's proficiency with CI tool maintenance and management. For team of (only) six persons, however, it can be speculated that a cloud-based CI solution is more feasible.
